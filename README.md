## Version History

**v1.1.5**
Added markdown files for singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list.

**v1.1.4**
Fixed README so that links to detailed data structure descriptions would work.

**v1.1.3:**
This update includes the following changes:
  - Some tests for the doubly linked list were changed to include extra edge cases.
  - Added a true circular linked list that has been fully tested. It does exactly the same thing as the original circular linked list except it works by having a reference to the head node on the tail node.
  - Made a proper README with different markdown files for stack, queue, and deque data structures.

**v1.1.2:**
All linear data structure are complete in this version. This includes:
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Deque (Double Ended Queue)
  - Singly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
